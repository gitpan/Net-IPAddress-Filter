This is the Perl distribution Net-IPAddress-Filter.

Installing Net-IPAddress-Filter is straightforward.

## Installation with cpanm

If you have cpanm, you only need one line:

    % cpanm Net::IPAddress::Filter

If you are installing into a system-wide directory, you may need to pass the
"-S" flag to cpanm, which uses sudo to install the module:

    % cpanm -S Net::IPAddress::Filter

## Installing with the CPAN shell

Alternatively, if your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do:

    % cpan Net::IPAddress::Filter

## Manual installation

## Documentation

Net-IPAddress-Filter documentation is available as POD.
You can run perldoc from a shell to read the documentation:

    % perldoc Net::IPAddress::Filter
